<h1>💿 INTERNET OLYMPICS 💿</h1>
<h2>⚔️ RULES On ruules on ruulz - robot chose that art not me idk what the fuck that is - it means nothing ⚔️</h2>

<div class="section">
<span class="important">Updated: 6/28 — Day 3 of THE INTERNET OLYMPICS</span><br>
Congrats 2 Series A(pocalypse) — you guys did good kidz. real good.
</div>

<div class="section">
Alright, degens 💥 — WELCOME 2 THE INTERNET OLYMPICS here’s how this is gonna work:
</div>

<div class="section">
You’ve each adopted a founder 🐣 and been sorted into a team:
<br><br>
<span class="important">🟦 TEAM 1: Y2KET CORP. 💾</span><br>
<span class="important">🟥 TEAM 2: SERIES A(POCALYPSE) 🔥</span>
</div>

<div class="section">
When you open the main game board (<span class="important">b04rd</span>), you’ll see a big, neon Jeopardy grid 🎯 that looks something like this:
</div>

<div class="ascii">

<div class="section">
✨ <span class="important">NOTE:</span> We’re playing <span class="important">one row at a time</span>. That means Day 1 is ONLY the $100 cards. Tomorrow we unlock $200, and so on. No skipping ahead 🥚.
</div>

<div class="section">
<span class="important">ROUND 2 RULES:</span><br>
Same as yesterday — one team picks a topic, and both teams race to finish all 5 categories 🏃💨. When all challenges are claimed, the team who scored the most on that card gets to pick the next one 🃏.
</div>

<div class="section">
Each round, a team takes turns picking a category and price. Inside each card, you’ll find up to <span class="important">5 hidden challenges</span> 🎱.
</div>

<div class="section">
<span class="important">HOW TO CLAIM A CHALLENGE 🎯:</span><br>
Both teams can attempt any challenge on an active card, but the first team to complete and submit proof ❤️ <span class="important">locks it down and gets the money</span> 💰.

Example: If Y2Ket finishes challenge 1 under a $300 card first, they bank $300 🌈.
</div>

<div class="section">
Once all challenges in a card have been claimed 🧠, the round ends. The team who won the majority under that card 🎲 gets to pick the next card 🎮.
</div>

<div class="section">
Between rounds, you’re allowed to use your weapons or advantages.
</div>

<div class="section">
Between rounds, you can also use your weapons to adjust teams, block players, or pull whatever power moves you’re scheming 💣.
This is also where you have an opportunity to make some dealz, propose your own challenges, and generally cause chaos 🕳️✨.
</div>

<div class="section">
<span class="important">NEW SCORING RULE 🪙:</span><br>
It’s still a race to score first — BUT if any player completes a challenge, you can also claim the payout as an individual 🕺, separate from your company.
<span class="important">LIQUID ASSETS Y’ALL 💰💸.</span>
</div>

<div class="section">
At the end of the game, the team with the most money 💵 — or maybe the most survivors 🐤 (we’ll decide how cruel we feel) — WINS EVERYTHING 🏆💥.
